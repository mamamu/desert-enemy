free code camp voting app project

Some refactoring done.  (mostly to do with accessing the database)

todos (prob do before refactoring)
//login logout jquery functionality
//user id database integration
//* voting functionality
//* voting front end/js file
//* voting api routes
//* make sure database structure for voting is working and user id + vote OK

//* need to add create addl poll option for logged in users
* work on css/display/color etc
* function to check if voted on a poll already
* display function to highlight the user choice when displaying polls--this needs to be accessible to the index and the profile pages. There are possibly other display functions that could be for both.  ID these. 


then refactoring

* passport?
